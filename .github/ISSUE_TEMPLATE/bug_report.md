Welcome to OCaml multicore's Issue tracker!

One thing that can greatly assist in debugging issues is if the
OCaml multicore build version information is included. You can determine
the OCaml multicore build version information with `ocamlrun -version`.

If you have questions about *using* OCaml, please ask at
https://discuss.ocaml.org (more people read Discuss than this tracker, and
you'll get confirmation of whether you've really found a bug or need a new
feature).
